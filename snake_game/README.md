# Snake Game
This is a simple snake game using pygame I created from scratch.
* Purpose: Get a better understanding of pygame and brush up on python
* Hours Spent: 5 hours
* Requires pygame to be installed in pip

### How to play
After downloading this directory, run 
```
python3 main.py
```
The objective is to eat as many food(red circles) as you can. You ultimately beat the game
if there are no more possible slots left and the screen will display a win message.

You lose if you either:
* Hit a wall
* Hit yourself

Controls:
* ðŸ ‰ Moves snake up
* ðŸ ‹ Moves snake down
* ðŸ ˆ Moves snake left
* ðŸ Š Moves snake right
* p to pause/unpause
